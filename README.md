# Travel Journal Guestbook

https://traveljournal-1.onrender.com

## A fully functioning form submission app for adding youâ€™re favourite country, created using Javascript, HTML, CSS, Express and SQL.

This app was developed as a group project during Week 5 of our Software Development Bootcamp, testing our knowledge from the first month of the course. Here's a brief overview of how the Travel Journal was created:

*Design: We used a wireframe to plan the layout of the webpage.
*Collaboration: Slack, Discord, and Google Meet were utilized for task management and communication, with a shared GitHub repository for code collaboration.
*Development: The app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with additional functionality powered by SQL.
*Database: SQL was used to store and display the information submitted via the form on the webpage.
*Deployment: Express was used on the server side, with APIs integrated, and the app was deployed on Render.
